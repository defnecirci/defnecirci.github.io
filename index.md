## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Cate Brinson](https://brinsonlab.pratt.duke.edu/) and Prof. [Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/). Prior to starting my PhD, I was an undergraduate student in materials science and computer science at Sabanci University.


## Research Interests
I am interested in the application of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in science, with a focus on knowledge extraction, question answering, and reasoning from scientific literature. Currently, I am working on extracting complex information from diverse scientific data sources, including charts, tables, and text, and evaluating LLM performance in these tasks. My goal is to automate the extraction of insights from scientific articles at scale and build comprehensive knowledge graphs and databases to accelerate discoveries in materials science. Additionally, I am interested in applying machine learning to materials property prediction tasks.
